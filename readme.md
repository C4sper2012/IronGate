<h3>Jeg har lavet noget Technical setup, Tilf√∏jelser/Rettelser?</h3>
/Tobias

## Technical setup "Working progress." 

### First floor:
- Climate monitoring in rooms.
- Window opening system(time based event?).
    - connected to in-door climate?
- Smart lighting.

### Ground floor:
- RFID Unlock/Lockdown (Affect all system systems).
    - Turns on selected lights
    - Closes all windows.

### Basement/Garage:

- Moisture monitoring(In case of flood when not home).
    - Alerts user?


### All levels:
- All Level has motions sensors that activates when alarm is armed.
- Main hub(HMI) to control the systems.
- Bluetooth redundancy if WiFi or MQTT fails?

<br>

---

- All peripherals at each level is hooked up to a mainboard using SPI or I2C.
- The mainboard uses SPI or I2C to connect to a second board with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth.
- The 3 WiFi boards communicate with each other using MQTT over WiFi.
